# AutoLux: Pre-Owned Luxury Car Management System

## Project Overview

**AutoLux** is a bespoke web application designed to streamline the management of a pre-owned luxury car inventory for a premium dealership.  
[cite_start]The system addresses the complexity and time-consuming nature of managing high-value vehicle inventory, sales, and customer interactions by providing a secure, streamlined platform with detailed specifications, brand-specific information, and powerful search capabilities[cite: 5].

[cite_start]The system is specifically designed for a **single administrative user** to manage all core activities[cite: 5].

* [cite_start]**Client:** Elite Auto Imports (Fictional)[cite: 5]  
* [cite_start]**Project Duration:** 6 Weeks (Executed across 2 Agile Sprints of 3 weeks each)[cite: 5]  
* [cite_start]**Team Size:** 6 Members[cite: 5]

## Database Schema (Entity Framework Core - Code-First)

[cite_start]The system utilizes two primary tablesâ€”**Cars** and **Brands**â€”demonstrating a clean, maintainable one-to-many relationship[cite: 5].

### 1. Cars Table (Core Inventory)
| Field | Data Type | Key/Note |
